# X-Road Central Server

**Central Server** is a component that manages all registrations of a local X-Road instance (security servers, members,
subsystems). It is the primary configuration source in an X-Road system. Central server always manages an internal
configuration source (i.e. configuration source distributing the internal configuration) and in addition, an external
configuration source (i.e. configuration source distributing the external configuration) in case the X-Road system is
federation-capable.
